# 15na Tools - `make-y`

This makes codomain for csi data.\
IMPORTANT: I suggest you to use "taking-video" method.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js 8+

### How to use

1. Go `make-y` directory and enter `npm i`.
2. Enter `npm start` on `make-y` directory.
3. Instructions for the program will be shown up to the screen.

### Caution

Start below two **simultaneously!**

-   Pressing `s` button on `make-y` program
-   Starting logging by launching `log_to_file` program

I recommend to using `sleep` command before `log_to_file`.

_Example:_

```bash
$ sudo bash -c "sleep 1; echo 3; sleep 1; echo 2; sleep 1; echo 1; sleep 1; echo 0; ./log_to_file record.dat"
```
